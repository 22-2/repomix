# Use Cases

Repomix's strength lies in its ability to work with any subscription service like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok without worrying about costs, while providing complete codebase context that eliminates the need for file exploration—making analysis faster and often more accurate.

With the entire codebase available as context, Repomix enables a wide range of applications including implementation planning, bug investigation, third-party library security checks, documentation generation, and much more.


## Real-World Use Cases

### Using Repomix with AI Assistants (Grok Example)
This video shows how to convert GitHub repositories into AI-readable formats using Repomix's web interface, then upload to AI assistants like Grok for strategic planning and code analysis.

**Use Case**: Quick repository conversion for AI tools
- Pack public GitHub repos via web interface
- Choose format: XML, Markdown, or Plain text
- Upload to AI assistants for codebase understanding

### Using Repomix with Simon Willison's LLM CLI Tool
Learn how to combine Repomix with [Simon Willison's llm CLI tool](https://github.com/simonw/llm) to analyze entire codebases. This video shows how to package repositories into XML format and feed them to various LLMs for Q&A, documentation generation, and implementation planning.

**Use Case**: Enhanced codebase analysis with LLM CLI
- Package repositories with `repomix` command
- Use `--remote` flag to pack directly from GitHub
- Attach output to LLM prompts with `-f repo-output.xml`
