# Use Cases

Repomix's strength lies in its ability to work with any subscription service without worrying about costs, while providing complete codebase context that eliminates the need for file exploration—making analysis faster and often more accurate.

With the entire codebase available as context, Repomix enables a wide range of applications including implementation planning, bug investigation, third-party library security checks, documentation generation, and much more.

## Code Analysis & Investigation & Refactoring

### Bug Investigation
Share your entire codebase with AI to identify the root cause of issues across multiple files and dependencies.

```
This codebase has a memory leak issue in the server. The application crashes after running for several hours. Please analyze the entire codebase and identify potential causes.
```

### Implementation Planning
Get comprehensive implementation advice that considers your entire codebase architecture and existing patterns.

```
I want to add user authentication to this application. Please review the current codebase structure and suggest the best approach that fits with the existing architecture.
```

### Refactoring Assistance
Get refactoring suggestions that maintain consistency across your entire codebase.

```
This codebase needs refactoring to improve maintainability. Please suggest improvements while keeping the existing functionality intact.
```

### Code Review
Comprehensive code review that considers the entire project context.

```
Please review this codebase as if you were doing a thorough code review. Focus on code quality, potential issues, and improvement suggestions.
```


## Documentation & Knowledge

### Documentation Generation
Generate comprehensive documentation that covers your entire codebase.

```
Generate comprehensive documentation for this codebase, including API documentation, setup instructions, and developer guides.
```

### Knowledge Extraction
Extract technical knowledge and patterns from your codebase.

```
Extract and document the key architectural patterns, design decisions, and best practices used in this codebase.
```

## Third-Party Library Analysis

### Dependency Security Audit
Analyze third-party libraries and dependencies for security issues.

```
Please analyze all third-party dependencies in this codebase for potential security vulnerabilities and suggest safer alternatives where needed.
```

### Library Integration Analysis
Understand how external libraries are integrated into your codebase.

```
Analyze how this codebase integrates with external libraries and suggest improvements for better maintainability.
```

## Real-World Examples

### LLM Code Generation Workflow
A developer shares how they use Repomix to extract code context from existing codebases, then leverage that context with LLMs like Claude and Aider for incremental improvements, code reviews, and automated documentation generation.

**Use Case**: Streamlined development workflow with AI assistance
- Extract complete codebase context
- Provide context to LLMs for better code generation
- Maintain consistency across the entire project

### Creating Knowledge Datapacks for LLMs
Authors are using Repomix to package their written content—blogs, documentation, and books—into LLM-compatible formats, enabling readers to interact with their expertise through AI-powered Q&A systems.

**Use Case**: Knowledge sharing and interactive documentation
- Package documentation into AI-friendly formats
- Enable interactive Q&A with content
- Create comprehensive knowledge bases
