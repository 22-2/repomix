# Coding Guidelines
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
- Split files into smaller, focused units when appropriate:
  - Aim to keep code files under 250 lines. If a file exceeds 250 lines, split it into multiple files based on functionality.
- Add comments to clarify non-obvious logic. **Ensure all comments are written in English.**
- Provide corresponding unit tests for all new features.

## Dependencies and Testing
- Inject dependencies through a deps object parameter for testability
- Example:
  ```typescript
  export const functionName = async (
    param1: Type1,
    param2: Type2,
    deps = {
      defaultFunction1,
      defaultFunction2,
    }
  ) => {
    // Use deps.defaultFunction1() instead of direct call
  };
  ```
- Mock dependencies by passing test doubles through deps object
- Use vi.mock() only when dependency injection is not feasible

# Generate Comprehensive Output
- Include all content without abbreviation, unless specified otherwise
- Optimize for handling large codebases while maintaining output quality

# Repomix Project Structure and Overview

This document provides a structural overview of the Repomix project, designed to aid AI code assistants (like Copilot) in understanding the codebase.

## Project Overview

Repomix is a tool that packs the contents of a software repository into a single file, making it easier for AI systems to analyze and process the codebase. It supports various output formats (plain text, XML, Markdown), ignores files based on configurable patterns, and performs security checks to exclude potentially sensitive information.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

```
repomix/
├── src/ # Main source code
│   ├── cli/ # Command-line interface logic (argument parsing, command handling, output)
│   ├── config/ # Configuration loading, schema, and defaults
│   ├── core/ # Core logic of Repomix
│   │   ├── file/ # File handling (reading, processing, searching, tree structure generation, git commands)
│   │   ├── metrics/ # Calculating code metrics (character count, token count)
│   │   ├── output/ # Output generation (different styles, headers, etc.)
│   │   ├── packager/ # Orchestrates file collection, processing, output, and clipboard operations.
│   │   ├── security/ # Security checks to exclude sensitive files
│   │   ├── tokenCount/ # Token counting using Tiktoken
│   │   └── tree-sitter/ # Code parsing using Tree-sitter and language-specific queries
│   └── shared/ # Shared utilities and types (error handling, logging, helper functions)
├── tests/ # Unit and integration tests (organized mirroring src/)
│   ├── cli/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── integration-tests/
│   ├── shared/

└── website/ # Documentation website (VitePress)
    ├── client/      # Client-side code (Vue.js components, styles, configuration)
    │   ├── .vitepress/  # VitePress configuration and theme
    │   │   ├── config/  # Site configuration files (navigation, sidebar, etc.)
    │   │   └── theme/   # Custom theme and styles
    │   ├── components/ # Vue.js components for the website
    │   └── src/        # Markdown files for the documentation in various languages (en, ja, etc.)
    └── server/      # Server-side API (for remote repository processing)
        └── src/       # Server source code (API endpoints, request handling)
```

# GitHub Release Note Guidelines
Here are some examples of release notes that follow the guidelines:

v0.2.25
````md
This release brings significant improvements to output formatting and introduces flexible remote repository handling capabilities along with enhanced logging features.

# Improvements ⚡

## Remote Repository Enhancement (#335)
- Added branch/tag parsing directly from repository URLs:
```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/0.1.x
```
Functions identically to:
```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 0.1.x
```

Special thanks to @huy-trn for implementing this user-friendly feature!

## Enhanced Output Formatting (#328, #329, #330)
- Added "End of Codebase" marker for better clarity in output
- Improved output header accuracy:
  - Better representation of codebase scope
  - Clear indication when using `--include` or `--ignore` options

Special thanks to @gitkenan for adding the "End of Codebase" marker and reporting the header issue!

## Path Pattern Support (#337)
- Added support for special characters in paths:
  - Handles parentheses in include patterns (e.g., `src/(categories)/**/*`)
  - Improved escaping for `[]` and `{}`
  - Essential for Next.js route groups and similar frameworks

Thank you @matheuscoelhomalta for improving path pattern support!

# How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```

````

v0.2.24
````md
This release significantly enhances configuration flexibility with comprehensive CLI flag support and expands default ignore patterns for better project scaffolding. 

# What's New 🚀

## CLI Flags Revolution (#324)
- New command-line configuration now available.

```
- `--no-gitignore`: Disable .gitignore file usage
- `--no-default-patterns`: Disable default patterns
- `--header-text <text>`: Custom text to include in the file header
- `--instruction-file-path <path>`: Path to a file containing detailed custom instructions
- `--include-empty-directories`: Include empty directories in the output
```

Special recognition to @massdo for driving ecosystem growth.

# Improvements ⚡

## Enhanced Ignore Patterns (#318, #322)
- Expanded default ignores for Rust projects:
  - `target/`, `Cargo.lock`, build artifacts
  - PHP, Ruby, Go, Elixir, Haskell: package manager lock files

To @boralg for helping curate Rust-specific patterns!

# How to Update
```bash
npm update -g repomix
```

v0.2.23
````md
This release adds significant performance improvements for large repositories, making Repomix faster and more efficient when needed.

# Improvements ⚡

## Parallel Processing Enhancement (#309)
- Implemented worker threads using [Piscina](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina) for parallel processing

### Benchmark Results
- `yamadashy.repomix`: No significant change
  - Before: 868.73 millis
  - After: 671.26 millis
- `facebook/react`: 29x faster
  - Before: 123.31 secs
  - After: 4.19 secs
- `vercel/next.js`: 58x faster
  - Before: 17.85 mins
  - After: 17.27 secs

Note: While Repomix is not primarily designed for processing large repositories, and speed is not a primary goal, faster processing can provide a better user experience when working with larger codebases.

# How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
