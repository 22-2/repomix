This release  brings improvements to the `--init` process.

## Improvements

### Enhanced `repopack --init` Process (#67)

- Separated the creation processes for `repopack.config.json` and `.repopackignore` files, allowing users more granular control over their setup.

These improvements make it easier for new users to get started with Repopack and provide a smoother configuration experience for all users.
