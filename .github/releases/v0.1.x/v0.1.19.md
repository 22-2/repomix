It's focusing on improved file filtering capabilities and overall performance enhancements. 

## New Features

### Support `include` (#22, #30)
- Introduced the `--include` CLI option for specifying files to include using glob patterns. 
- Added support for `include` patterns in the configuration file.

To pack specific files or directories using glob patterns:
```bash
repopack --include "src/**/*.ts,**/*.md"
```

Special thanks to @IsaacSante for their contributions.

## Improvements

### Performance Optimization
- Replaced the `ignore` package with `globby` for more efficient file filtering.
