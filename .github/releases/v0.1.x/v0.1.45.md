This release adds important migration notices as we prepare to transition from Repopack to Repomix.

## Important: Project Renamed to Repomix

Due to legal considerations, this project has been renamed from "Repopack" to "Repomix". We are committed to ensuring a smooth transition for all users.

### How to Migrate

We strongly recommend migrating to the new package. Install Repomix using either:

```bash
npx repomix
```

or

```bash
npm install -g repomix
```

#### Optional: Uninstall Repopack
After confirming Repomix works for your needs, you can optionally uninstall Repopack:

```bash
npm uninstall -g repopack
```

Thank you for being part of the Repopack community. We look forward to continuing to serve you as Repomix! If you have any questions about the migration, please feel free to create an issue on our GitHub repository.
