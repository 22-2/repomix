This update brings a significant new feature that enhances the tool's utility for working with large language models.

## New Features

### Token Counting Support (#39)

Thanks to the fantastic contribution from @joshellington, Repopack now includes token counting functionality:

- Added token counts for individual files and the entire repository
- Updated CLI output to display token information in the summary and top files list

This feature is particularly useful for users working within context limits of large language models like GPT-4.

A huge thank you to @joshellington for this valuable contribution!
