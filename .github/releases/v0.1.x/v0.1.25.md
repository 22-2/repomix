This update introduces global configuration support, allowing for more consistent settings across projects.

## What's New

### Global Configuration Support (#51, #52)

- Added support for global configuration files
- Implemented `repopack --init --global` command to create a global config
- Global config locations:
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Repopack\repopack.config.json`
  - macOS/Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/repopack/repopack.config.json` or `~/.config/repopack/repopack.config.json`
- Local configs still take precedence when present

To update, simply run:
```
npm update -g repopack
```
