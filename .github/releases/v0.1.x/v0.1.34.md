This release focuses on improving the default ignore patterns, particularly for subdirectories.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Default Ignore Patterns (#68)

- Fixed an issue where dependency directories in subdirectories (particularly `node_modules`) were not being ignored correctly.
- Updated default ignore patterns include more comprehensive patterns:
  - Included additional common dependency directories for various languages (e.g., `vendor`, `.bundle`, `.gradle`, `target`).
