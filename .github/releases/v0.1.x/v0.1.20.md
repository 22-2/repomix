## Changes

### gitignore Syntax Compliance
- Fixed handling of `.gitignore` and `.repopackignore` files to properly comply with gitignore syntax.
- This ensures more accurate and consistent file filtering based on your ignore patterns.

### Change File Filtering Logic
- Migrated custom ignore pattern processing from gitignore syntax to glob patterns. 

## Notes

- This update may affect which files are included/excluded in the packed output. We recommend reviewing your ignore patterns to ensure desired behavior.
- If you're using a custom configuration, make sure to update your `ignore.customPatterns` to use glob patterns instead of gitignore syntax.
