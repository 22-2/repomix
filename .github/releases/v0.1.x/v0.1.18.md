It's focusing on security improvements and output refinements. 

## Improvements
###  Security Enhancements: Exclude Suspicious Files
- Implemented a filter to exclude potentially sensitive files from the output. 
- This improvement prevents the inclusion of suspicious files, enhancing overall security.

## Fixes
### Prevent Recursive Output Issues
- Modified the `getFilePaths` function in `src/core/packager.ts` to exclude the output file from processing.
- This fix resolves a recursive issue where the output file was being included in itself.

## Changes
### XML Escaping Removal
- Removed XML escaping for file paths and contents in repository files.
- This change improves readability and AI comprehension of the generated output.

Note: This update assumes that input data (file paths, contents, etc.) does not contain characters that would break XML syntax. If there's a possibility of such characters, we may implement a more robust solution in the future, such as using CDATA sections for file contents.
