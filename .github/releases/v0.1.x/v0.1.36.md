This release introduces a new configuration option that allows users to control the security check feature, providing more flexibility in how Repopack handles sensitive information detection.

## What's New

### Configurable Security Check (#74, #75)

- Added new configuration option `security.enableSecurityCheck` (default: `true`)
  - Users can now disable the security check when needed, such as when working with cryptographic libraries or known false positives

## How to Use

To **disable** the security check, add the following to your `repopack.config.json`:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "enableSecurityCheck": false
  }
}
```

**Note:** Disabling the security check may expose sensitive information. Use this option with caution and only when necessary.

```
