This release enhances header configuration control, adds JSON Schema validation, and improves Docker integration for the MCP server with comprehensive documentation updates.

## Improvements âš¡

### Enhanced `--no-file-summary` Option (#556)
- `--no-file-summary` now also suppresses the generation header
  - Header text (`headerText`) is still displayed, maintaining custom messages
  - Users can now control headers more flexibly and intuitively, showing custom headers while hiding Repomix-generated content

Special thanks to @joshwand for this significant improvement!

### JSON Schema Configuration Validation (#570)
- Added JSON schema for `repomix.config.json` validation
  - Enables auto-completion and validation in supported editors
  - Improves developer experience in VSCode and other editors with JSON schema support
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json",
  "output": {
    "filePath": "repomix-output.md",
    "style": "markdown"
  }
}
```
