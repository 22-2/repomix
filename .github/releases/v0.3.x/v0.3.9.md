### CLI Exit Code Enhancement (#632)
Repomix now properly sets exit codes when operations fail, significantly improving CI/CD integration and error handling workflows. This enhancement ensures that build pipelines and automation scripts can correctly detect and respond to Repomix failures.

Special thanks to @sakamossan for implementing this important feature! 

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
