## Improvements ‚ö°

### Semantic Suggestion System for CLI (#452)
Added functionality that automatically suggests correct options when incorrect option names are entered.

Special thanks to @pranshugupta01 for this thoughtful usability enhancement that makes the CLI experience much more intuitive for users!

### Glob Pattern Handling Improvements
- Automatically removes extra whitespace from comma-separated glob patterns (#464)
- Consistently handles directory patterns with trailing slashes, making `folder/` and `folder` patterns behave the same way (#453)
- Improved brace expansion and whitespace handling in CLI pattern options for more accurate and predictable behavior with complex glob patterns (#469)
