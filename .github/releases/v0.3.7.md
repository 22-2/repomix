This release brings major enhancements to the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and improved remote repository handling.

## What's New ðŸš€

### MCP Tool Grep Functionality (#590)

We've added a powerful `grep_repomix_output` tool to the Repomix MCP server! This feature enables AI assistants to perform advanced searches within packaged codebases. Additionally, the `read_repomix_output` tool now supports partial content retrieval.

This functionality allows AI assistants to efficiently search for specific patterns in codebases and retrieve results with surrounding context.
By combining the `grep_repomix_output` and `read_repomix_output` tools, repository analysis is now possible without fetching the entire output, making it particularly useful for analyzing medium to large-scale repositories.

## Improvements âš¡

### CLI Help Group Feature Implementation (#578)

The CLI help display has been improved. Options are now organized into logical groups for better usability:

```bash
$ repomix -h
Usage: repomix [options] [directories...]

Repomix - Pack your repository into a single AI-friendly file

Arguments:
  directories                        list of directories to process (default: ["."])

Basic Options
  -v, --version                      show version information

Output Options
  -o, --output <file>                specify the output file name
  --stdout                           output to stdout instead of writing to a file
  --style <type>                     specify the output style (xml, markdown, plain)
  --parsable-style                   by escaping and formatting, ensure the output is parsable as a
                                     document of its type
  --compress                         perform code compression to reduce token count
  
Filter Options
  --include <patterns>               list of include patterns (comma-separated)
  -i, --ignore <patterns>            additional ignore patterns (comma-separated)

...
```

### Enhanced Remote Repository Reference Handling (#583, #592)

Remote repository processing has become more robust with improved URL handling:

- The `--remote` option now handles URLs more precisely by reading refs to correctly distinguish between branch names and folder paths
- Proper identification and processing of remote branches and tags
- Better handling of repository paths and subdirectories

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
