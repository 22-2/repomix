This release introduces new configuration options to control the output of the file summary and directory structure sections, providing more flexibility in customizing the output.

## What's New

### Customizable File Summary and Directory Structure Output (#206, #224)

- Added `output.fileSummary` option (default: `true`): Controls whether to include the file summary section at the beginning of the output.
- Added `output.directoryStructure` option (default: `true`): Controls whether to include the directory structure in the output.

These options allow you to tailor the output to your specific needs. For example:

-   You can omit the file summary and directory structure to reduce token usage when interacting with LLMs.
-   You can include only necessary sections to generate output optimized for specific AI models.

**Example Configuration:**

```json5
{
  "output": {
    "fileSummary": false,
    "directoryStructure": true,
    // ... other settings
  }
}
```


To update to the latest version, run:
```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
