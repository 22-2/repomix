This release introduces remote repository features and security check improvements.

## What's New

### Enhanced Remote Repository Support (#196, #199)
- Added new `--remote-branch` option for cloning specific branches

Example usage:
```bash
# Clone a specific branch
repomix --remote user/repo --remote-branch develop
```

Special thanks to @tranquochuy645 for their first contribution, adding the remote branch feature!

### Security Check Improvements (#191, #201)
- Added `--no-security-check` command line option for more control over security checking
- Enables bypassing security checks when needed (e.g., when working with cryptographic libraries)

```
