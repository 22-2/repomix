This release focuses on enhancing usability, flexibility, and remote repository handling. We've aimed to make Repomix more intuitive, particularly for those working with remote repositories or using custom configurations.

## What's New

### Support Commit SHA in --remote-branch Option (#195, #212)
- The `--remote-branch` option now supports specific commit hashes, not just branch names or tags.
  - This allows users to checkout the remote repository to a specific state using a SHA, providing finer control over remote repository fetching.
 
For more details, please see [Remote Repository Processing](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix?tab=readme-ov-file#remote-repository-processing) in the README.

Thank you to @tranquochuy645 for this valuable contribution!

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed an issue where instruction file is not found when using a custom config file (#231)
-   The instruction file path is now resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD) instead of the location of the config file.
