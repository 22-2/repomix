This release fixes an important configuration issue affecting negative boolean options in Repomix.

## Bug Fixes üêõ

### Configuration Handling Fix (#385, #389)
- Fixed an issue where setting `false` values in the config file for certain options (like `"fileSummary": false`) was not being respected
- Properly handles all `--no-*` style CLI options when specified in the config file
- Affected options include:
  - `fileSummary`
  - `directoryStructure`
  - `gitignore`
  - `defaultPatterns`
  - `securityCheck`

Special thanks to @mapleroyal for reporting this issue!
