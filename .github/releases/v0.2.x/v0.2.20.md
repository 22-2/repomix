## Bug Fixes üêõ

### Git Worktree Support (#279)
- Fixed an issue where Repomix fails when processing repositories created using `git worktree`
  - Now correctly handles `.git` as a reference file in worktree repositories

Special thanks to @slavashvets for discovering and fixing this issue! 

### Repository Name Validation
