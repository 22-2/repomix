This release brings significant improvements to output formatting and introduces flexible remote repository handling capabilities along with enhanced logging features.

# Improvements âš¡

## Remote Repository Enhancement (#335)
- Added branch/tag parsing directly from repository URLs:
```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/0.1.x
```
Functions identically to:
```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 0.1.x
```

Special thanks to @huy-trn for implementing this user-friendly feature!

## Enhanced Output Formatting (#328, #329, #330)
- Added "End of Codebase" marker for better clarity in output
- Improved output header accuracy:
  - Better representation of codebase scope
  - Clear indication when using `--include` or `--ignore` options

Special thanks to @gitkenan for adding the "End of Codebase" marker and reporting the header issue!

## Path Pattern Support (#337)
- Added support for special characters in paths:
  - Handles parentheses in include patterns (e.g., `src/(categories)/**/*`)
  - Improved escaping for `[]` and `{}`
  - Essential for Next.js route groups and similar frameworks

Thank you @matheuscoelhomalta for improving path pattern support!
