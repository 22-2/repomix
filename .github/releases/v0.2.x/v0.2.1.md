This release introduces our rename from Repopack to Repomix, along with automated migration functionality to ensure a smooth transition for all users.

## Important: Project Renamed to Repomix

Due to legal considerations, this project has been renamed from "Repopack" to "Repomix". We are committed to ensuring a smooth transition for all users.

### What's New

#### Automated Migration Support (v0.2.1)
- Added functionality to automatically detect and migrate existing Repopack configurations
- Handles migration of:
  - Configuration files (`repopack.config.json` → `repomix.config.json`)
  - Ignore files (`.repopackignore` → `.repomixignore`)
  - Instruction files (`repopack-instruction.md` → `repomix-instruction.md`)
  - Both local and global configurations
- Preserves all user settings during migration

#### Project Rename Changes (v0.2.0)
- Updated all project files and references to use the new name
- Updated npm package name to `repomix`
- Updated documentation to reflect the new name
- Added support for legacy output file detection

### How to Migrate

We strongly recommend migrating to the new package. Install Repomix using either:

```bash
npx repomix
```

or

```bash
npm install -g repomix
```

The tool will automatically detect your existing Repopack configuration files and offer to migrate them to the new format.

#### Optional: Uninstall Repopack
After confirming Repomix works for your needs, you can optionally uninstall Repopack:

```bash
npm uninstall -g repopack
```
