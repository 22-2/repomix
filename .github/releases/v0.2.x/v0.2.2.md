This release adds a new clipboard copy feature and includes several internal improvements to our CI process.

## What's New

### Copy to Clipboard Feature (#152, #160)

- Added new `--copy` option to copy the output to system clipboard
- Output can now be both saved to file and copied to clipboard in one command
- Configurable through `repomix.config.json` using `output.copyToClipboard` option

We'd like to thank @vznh for implementing this feature in their first contribution to Repomix!

## Internal Changes

### CI Improvements

- Switched to official actionlint Docker image for more reliable CI checks (@szepeviktor in #156)
- Re-added Homebrew bump workflow for automated formula updates (@chenrui333 in #151)

## How to Use

Copy output to clipboard using CLI:
```bash
repomix --copy
```

Or configure it in `repomix.config.json`:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "copyToClipboard": true
  }
}
```
