This release addresses two important issues to improve code handling and file output capabilities.

# Bug Fixes üêõ

## TypeScript Import Handling for Compressed Output (#382)
- Fixed an issue where named imports were partially excluded when using compress mode
  - Now properly preserves all import statements including named imports like `import { Component } from 'module'`

## Directory Structure Support for Output Files (#378, #383)
- Fixes related issue (#378) where nested output paths would fail, especially with remote repositories
  - Now automatically creates parent directories when writing to nested output paths

# How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
