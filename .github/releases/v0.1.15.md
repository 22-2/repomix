It appears I've been fashionably late to the release notes soir√©e.  It's like we've been living under a rock from v0.1.1 to v0.1.14. But they, better late than never, as they say in the world of procrastinating developers.

## New Features

### Output Style Options
- Introducing the `output.style` configuration option:
  - `plain`: The classic output format.
  - `xml`: An XML-structured output for enhanced parsing.

This addition aims to provide more flexibility in how Repopack structures its output.

For those interested in the potential of XML tags in AI contexts:

## How to Use

Add `output.style` to your configuration and select either `plain` or `xml`. The choice is yours, based on your project needs.
