This release adds significant performance improvements for large repositories, making Repomix faster and more efficient when needed.

# Improvements âš¡

## Parallel Processing Enhancement (#309)
- Implemented worker threads using [Piscina](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina) for parallel processing

### Benchmark Results
- `yamadashy.repomix`: No significant change
  - Before: 868.73 millis
  - After: 671.26 millis
- `facebook/react`: 29x faster
  - Before: 123.31 secs
  - After: 4.19 secs
- `vercel/next.js`: 58x faster
  - Before: 17.85 mins
  - After: 17.27 secs

Note: While Repomix is not primarily designed for processing large repositories, and speed is not a primary goal, faster processing can provide a better user experience when working with larger codebases.

# How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
