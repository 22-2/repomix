This release introduces improvements to file handling and output formatting, enhancing Repopack's functionality and user experience.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Markdown Support (#86, #95)

- Improved code block formatting in Markdown output:
  - Added language identifiers to code blocks for better syntax highlighting
  - Extended support for various file extensions to improve language detection
- Dynamic output file extension:
  - The extension of the output file now changes based on the selected style (e.g., `.md` for Markdown, `.xml` for XML)
  - This behavior only applies when no specific output file path is provided by the user

### Enhanced Exclusion of Package Manager Lock Files (#90, #94)

- Improved exclusion of common package manager lock files:
  - npm: `package-lock.json`
  - Yarn: `yarn.lock`
  - pnpm: `pnpm-lock.yaml`
  - These files are now automatically excluded from the packed output, including those in subdirectories

## How to Update

To update to the latest version, run:

```bash
npm update -g repopack
```
