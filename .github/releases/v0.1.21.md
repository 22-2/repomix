## Improvements

### Enhanced ignore files support (#34, #35)
- Updated the file filtering logic to consider `.gitignore`, `.repopackignore` files in all directories, not just the root.
- This change ensures that all ignore files, regardless of their location in the project structure, are properly respected during the file filtering process.

## Notes
- This update improves the handling of ignore files in your project structure. You may notice changes in which files are included or excluded if you have ignore files in subdirectories.
