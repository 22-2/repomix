This release adds MCP server support, improves ignore pattern handling on the website, and includes dependency updates.

## What's New üöÄ

### MCP Server Support (#399)
* Added initial implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server
  * Allows AI assistants to directly interact with your codebase without manual file preparation
  * Provides two powerful tools:
    * `pack_codebase`: Package local code directories for AI analysis
    * `pack_remote_repository`: Fetch, clone and package GitHub repositories

We've also submitted Repomix to the MCP marketplace:
- https://github.com/cline/mcp-marketplace/issues/64

To use Repomix as an MCP server with Cline (VS Code extension), edit the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repomix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "repomix",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Improvements ‚ö°Ô∏è

### Enhanced Ignore Pattern Support (#396)
* Now allows special characters like `!` `(` `)` in ignore patterns via the website

**Known Issue**: There's currently an issue where negation patterns (`!`) don't work correctly. See [Issue #400](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/issues/400) for details.
